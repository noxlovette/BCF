        <h2 class="text-4xl">why?</h2>
      <p class="font-light">Because reliable and regularly updated sources of perfume ingredient information are scarce online.

        Similar applications exist, but they operate in isolation.
        This app aims to invigorate the industry by fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>
