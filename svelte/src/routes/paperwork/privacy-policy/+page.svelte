  <p>We use reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the information that we have about you from unauthorised or unlawful access, use, modification, destruction, loss, alteration and/ or disclosure.</p>

  <p>The encrypted part of your experience with the website, namely, your custom ingredients, formulas, your subjective views on certain perfume compounds are encrypted. We cannot name the standard out of security reasons, but this is the industry's top encryption method. This is NOT end-to-end encryption, though.

  <p>We require third parties acting on our behalf or with whom we disclose your information to provide security measures in accordance with industry standards and in compliance with contractual obligations, their privacy and security obligations, and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We are not responsible for the privacy and security practices of such third parties outside the information we receive from or disclose to them.
