# BCF

This is a web app for perfumers. Users can browse IFRA’s FIG of 3100 perfume compounds, manage their collection of ingredients (what they have in the lab, for example), store, and create perfume formulas. Everything happens in a safe environment, the collection and formula data are encrypted.

## Features
- Browse through IFRA’s database of perfume compounds and contribute to BCF's knowledge base.
- Manage a personal collection of ingredients and enrich it with subjective data.
- Create and store perfume formulas that will change the industry.
- Secure data storage with encryption.
